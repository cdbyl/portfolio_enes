Sandri and I decided to analyze a region that is frequently studied across different subjects. Driven by the lack of detailed spatial data for the degraded Reconquista Basin, we focused on generating new insights for this specific area.\nBy replicating ACUMAR’s methodology, this study aims to generate comparable results and utilize cartographic visualization to identify vulnerable areas, ultimately providing a strategic tool for institutions to optimize resource allocation and design targeted socio-environmental policies.\nAlthough we were unable to calculate the full index due to data limitations (specifically the environmental and education components), we successfully computed the housing and health metrics. This allowed us to perform a comparative analysis against the Matanza-Riachuelo index."

When comparing with ACUMAR’s data from Matanza-Riachuelo basin, we only compared to those two, and using the same scale for visualization as the one proposed by ACUMAR.\n\n\nProcess\n\nThe fundamental spatial unit used was the “radio censal” (census radius), which is the smallest unit of geography used by INDEC for census reporting. All datasets with a coarser resolution were transformed to match this base layer, ensuring the analysis utilized the highest resolution available.\nAlthough operations were performed for all census radii of all comprising departments of the Basin, for visualization purposes only those within the Basin were shown. This happens because a basin is defined by physical characteristics unlike political boundaries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\nconfig:\n  theme: base\n  flowchart:\n    padding: 5\n---\nflowchart TD\n    C(Basin Boundary) --&gt;|Crop| B(Mask) --&gt; Y\n    A(Water courses) --&gt;|Crop| Y\n    D(Census radii) --&gt; |Selection of housing variables| E(Housing Index raw data) --&gt; |Operations| F(Housing Index) --&gt; Y\n    G(Public health establishments) --&gt; |Buffer, dissolve| H(Health Index)\n    I(Static waste disposal map) --&gt; |Digitalization from satellite images| J(Waste disposal locations) --&gt; |Buffer and scoring by distance| H --&gt; Y\n    K(Political boundaries) --&gt; Y([Join]) --&gt; |Visualization| Z(Final cartographic product)\nlinkStyle default stroke:#40A355, stroke-width:2px;\nclassDef default stroke:#40A355,stroke-width:2px;"

The analysis focused exclusively on “urban” census radii, covering 27.91% of the basin’s surface area but representing 96.21% of the total population (2,942,680 inhabitants).\nThe study revealed that the vast majority of the population lives in vulnerable conditions: * Very High: 0.16% * High: 12.50% * Medium: 10.43% * Low: 37.04% * Very Low: 39.83%\n\nDimensional Analysis\nThe Health Index revealed widespread needs (driven by a lack of basic sanitary services), whereas the Housing Index showed generally better conditions with specific pockets requiring state intervention.\n\n\nSpatial Findings\n\nHigh QLI: Areas closest to CABA and high-density urban zones (often surrounding railway stations) showed the highest quality of life values.\nLow QLI: Conversely, areas in close proximity to water bodies tended to have the lowest values.\nBasin Distribution: No clear distinction was observed between the middle and lower basins in terms of QLI, though the middle basin presented more rural and mixed-use zones."
