## Project Overview

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="35%" .text-justify}
*Pampa Linda* is the main valley and nearest settlement at the base of Cerro Tronador. The mountain was named *Tronador* — Spanish for "Thunderer" — because of the sound of falling ice heard as one approaches the peak. 
It is the highest and most prominent mountain in Nahuel Huapi National Park, standing at 3,554 meters above sea level.
