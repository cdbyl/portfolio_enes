## Project Overview

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="45%" .text-justify}
The annual event "*Vuelta en Bici a la Ciudad de Buenos Aires*" consists of a mass tour of the city, departing counterclockwise from Parque Lezama. The ride is about 70 km long and takes between 10 to 12 hours to complete, with two fixed intermediate stops.

I used public transport to get to the starting point and to return, and I wanted to show that on this map as well. The symbols were chosen with accessibility in mind, ensuring the visualization does not rely solely on color.
